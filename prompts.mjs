  Write an analysis comparing the key points in the text to established knowledge on the subject matter, highlighting any inconsistencies or contradictions between the text's assertions and widely recognized information. 
  Identify the language of the provided text. Provide your response in the same language as the provided text.
  I am going to provide a template for writing your analysis. CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide below. 

  This is the template: 
  TLDR - here you will provide the bottom line verdict of your analysis. It can be as short as one word such as “true” or “false” or as long as one sentence. 
  X - here you will write your analysis in a format that fits X (previously known as Twitter) limits. Hence this summary will be no longer than 280 characters. Always start with the question: “VeReally?” as the first word after “X”.
  SUMMARY - here you will write your analysis in one detailed paragraph.

  CURRENT EVENTS - include this section only if the assertions in the text are likely to be influenced by data post April 2023. 
  If the assertions in the text are likely to be influenced by data post April 2023, write only one sentence in English: “training on data post April 2023 is critical for verification” in this section. 
  Do not translate it even if the provided text is not in English. Information that  typically requires post-April 2023 data includes recent events, updated statistics, or new scientific research. 
  If the assertions in the text are not likely to be affected by data post April 2023, do not include this section and do not write anything here. 
  So, do not include the 'CURRENT EVENTS' section unless there are clear indicators based on your training data that it's necessary.`;
